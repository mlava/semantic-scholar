Access the scientific literature right within your Roam Research graph.

This extension allows you to get data from the 214 Million Papers, 2.49 Billion Citations and 79 Million Authors in Semantic Scholar database.

There are a number of ways to access the data:
- Article title search
- Article Id search
- Author name search
- Author Id search
- Recommended articles using one article as the prompt
- Relevant articles for a search term

To import a specific article, you can use IDs from Semantic Scholar (Corpus Id or Paper Id), DOI, Association for Computational Linguistics ID (ACL), arXiv ID, Microsoft Academic Graph ID (MAG), PubMed ID or PubMed Central ID. You can control which data is retrieved for an individual article by setting your preferences in the Roam Depot settings in the Article tab.

Author metadata can be imported using the Semantic Scholar Author ID. Again, the data types you wish to retrieve for an author can be set in the Author tab in the Roam Depot settings.

You can search for a paper by title, and Semantic Scholar will only return a single result. Of course, you can filter the search to limit to particular Fields of Study, years of publication, venue of publication, minimum citation count, Open Access status and the availability of an Open Access PDF.

Or, search for an author by name and Semantic Scholar will return a list of authors. You can define how many you want to retrieve in the Author tab in settings.

Semantic Scholar uses a machine learning algorithm to determine relationships between articles, and you can access this feature in two ways. The first is to 

Semantic Scholar classifies their data using the following Fields of Study:
- Computer Science
- Medicine
- Chemistry
- Biology
- Materials Science
- Physics
- Geology
- Psychology
- Art
- History
- Geography
- Sociology
- Business
- Political Science
- Economics
- Philosophy
- Mathematics
- Engineering
- Environmental Science
- Agricultural and Food Sciences
- Education
- Law
- Linguistics

You can set your preferred Fields of Study in the Roam Depot settings for this extension as comma-separated list. e.g. Medicine,Biology,Business

To limit the years from which article searches are conducted, use a year (e.g. 2024) or year range (2023-2024) in the relevant field in the pop-up when you trigger a search.
